# Python Project for Data Science Certificate

<h1 align="center">Analysis of Stock Performance and Dashboard Building</h1>


Welcome to my GitHub repository for the "Python Project for Data Science" certificate. In this project, I've assumed the role of a Data Scientist working for a startup investment firm. My primary task was to extract financial data and create a dashboard for analyzing and visualizing key performance indicators (KPIs) of popular stocks such as Tesla, Amazon, AMD, and GameStop. 

## Project Overview

In this project, I've leveraged Python libraries and web scraping techniques to gather data from various sources. The primary objectives of this project included:

- Extracting historical share prices of selected stocks.
- Collecting quarterly revenue reports.
- Visualizing and analyzing the data in a dashboard.
- Identifying patterns and trends in the stock market.

## Dashboard Analytics Displayed

The dashboard created in this project serves as a platform for visualizing key performance indicators. I've employed Plotly for data visualization, allowing for clear and interactive representations of the data. The dashboard helps in understanding and monitoring the performance of the selected stocks, making it a valuable tool for investment decisions.

## Tools and Technologies Used

For this project, I utilized the following tools and technologies:

- **Python:** The primary programming language used for data extraction, analysis, and visualization.
- **Jupyter:** An interactive environment for running Python code and creating data analysis notebooks.
- **GitHub:** This repository serves as a platform to share and showcase the project.
- **IBM Watson Studio:** An essential component that provided a collaborative environment for data scientists and data analysts.
- **IBM Cloud Pak for Data:** A suite of tools and collaborative environments that facilitate data science projects.
